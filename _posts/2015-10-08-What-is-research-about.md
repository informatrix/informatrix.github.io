title: What is the research about?
---

What's the research? Different people have different understanding about what is research. During my PH.D study time, I am always puzzled by a few questions.

1. What's research about?
2. Why do I want to do research?
3. Do I have the potential to do research?
4  What's the relationship between PH.D and research?
5. How to do a excellent research?

Although it is a failure, I still think it may be helpful to write the lessons.

## What's research about?

## How to do good research?

## Why do I quit research?

## PH.D is not equal to research
