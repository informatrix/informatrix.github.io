title: Positive Definite and Its Application
---

The concept of `postive definite` has puzzled me when I first saw it. It's intuitive to think about the positive number, e.g. `+5`. But what does it mean by saying a matrix is positive? And you can see a lot of `positive definite` or 'semi-positive definite` as the requirement for some mathematical tools. In this article, I will try to summarize what my knowledge regarding the PD.

## Definition

First, let's define what is `positive definite`. In `linear algebra`, a `symmetric real` matrix $$M$$ is said to be **positve definite** if $$z^TMz$$ is postive for every `non-zero` vector $$z$$.
