Deep learning has been popular in both industry and academic for quite a while. It is so impressive that every machine learning position would ask you about the `deep learning`. It is not exaggerated to say that machine learning has been dominated by deep learning now. The success of deep learning can be attributed to the modern inference algorithms.

With the background of `Gaussian process`, I am always to figure out the connection between GP and DP, while currently there is not much work that tries to improve each other from leveraging modern research achievement of each side. I will write down what I have learned and thought about while diving into deep learning. Hope it can also help someone who is the beginner like me.
