title: How to make a good product
---

There are two companies I know is producing the great products. One is Apple, the other is Google. The quality of the product is the core for a company. If you are a perfectionist, you will have a high standard for the product. Or if you are a good service provider, you can also make a great product since you want to satisfy the customers as much as possible.

To make the product somehow is quite different to do research. In research, it's about new theory. However, in industry it's about using the current techniques to make a product that can improve people's life. Some great product may not be very theoretically hard, but it requires much engineering work. For example, to have a better face recognization result, researcher may focus on improving the classfication algorithm. But another dimension about the performance is the informaiton itself. Some time we need the complicated model is because we don't have enough information, so we need to encode lots prior. However, we may have an `Aha` moment when we have some new data. This is more like doing science, it's about to discover the new data or the materical.
