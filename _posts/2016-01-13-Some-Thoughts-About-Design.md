title: How to make a good product
---

There are two companies I know is producing the great products. One is Apple, the other is Google. The quality of the product is the core for a company. If you are a perfectionist, you will have a high standard for the product. Or if you are a good service provider, you can also make a great product since you want to satisfy the customers as much as possible.

To make the product somehow is quite different to do research. In research, it's about new theory. However, in industry it's about using the current techniques to make a product that can improve people's life. Some great product may not be very theoretically hard, but it requires much engineering work. For example, to have a better face recognization result, researcher may focus on improving the classfication algorithm. But another dimension about the performance is the informaiton itself. Some time we need the complicated model is because we don't have enough information, so we need to encode lots prior. However, we may have an `Aha` moment when we have some new data. This is more like doing science, it's about to discover the new data or the materical.

For example, to score the products it's important to have reviewing system. One challenging is to prevent the fake reviews, and make the reviewing system fair enough. It is easy to have some tools to autogenerate some good reviewers to have a fake reputation. But considering the banking system, they have a credit system to track the customers. Somehow I think it can be super helpful to build such a customer/service credit system. It's like when I first meet you, I can check your personal credit to judge what you say.

### High-performance car and high-end watch

Both these two things get one common thing: `high quality`. The engineer push them so hard to make the best product for the customers. It's not about just make the product and do business, it's about pursuing the perfection. In my opinion, there always is a philosohpy behind any top product or company. It's their philosphy that push them build these spectacular product. It would be interesting to compare the software industry with the car or watch industry. Is it possible to have some luxurious software product like those of Ferrari or Porsche?
