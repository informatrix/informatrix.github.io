title: Object Detection with Discriminatively Parted Based Models
---

In this article, I will discuss about three papers, which are start-of-the-art of object detection. They are
   1. Cascade
   2. Histogram of oriented gradients
   3. Deformable part model

### Cascade

The paper of the paper is very simple. There are mainly two steps to do object detection.
    1. 

### Histogram of oriented gradients

### Deformable part model
