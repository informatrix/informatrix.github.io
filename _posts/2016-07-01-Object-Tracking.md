For automatic/intelligent industry application, object detection and object tracking are critical step. Take a step further,


##Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT)

SIFT feature descriptor is invariant to uniform scaling, orientation and partially invariant to affine distortion and illumination changes.

### Scale spaces

The first step is to create a scale space. Take the original image and generate progrssively blurred out images.
