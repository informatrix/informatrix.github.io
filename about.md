Growing up in beautiful village in China, Alfred was only able to play with computer since his collage. He likes Math, Physics and lots other who could be exciting. Sometime Alfred thinks he is special, and he wants to change the world. 

During last few years, he has done a little research work on machine learning and artificial intelligence. And most importantly, Alfred is always passionate about understanding our living world. During his free time, Alfred likes sports, especially badminton which he was used to be addicted to.

Inspired by current `open source` and `open science` community, Alfred is also motivated to contribute his own thoughts on his learning process. With these sharing experiences, knowledge and ideas, Alfred believe that we can together build a more open and united world.

Regarding the research, Alfred is more interested in discovering the fundamental ideas behind those classic models, and how these ideas can be applied in the real world and solve our real problem. Alfred believes in `the simple is the beauty` philosphy.
